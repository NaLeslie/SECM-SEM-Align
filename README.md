# SECM-SEM-Align
Alignment tool for scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images

Project for aligning SECM and SEM images to allow for feature shape to be extracted from SEM images so that reactivity can be fit from SECM images.
As of 2022-07-06, most of the features are in place.

Features still to be implemented:
- Support for SECM file-types (HEKA .mat, .asc, SECMX, etc.)
- Saving just the SECM and SEM image so that the same location on both can be plotted in publications.
- Automatic means to optimise the rotation and offset of the SEM image.
